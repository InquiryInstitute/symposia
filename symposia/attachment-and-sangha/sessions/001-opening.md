# Session 001: The Gathering
## Opening: The Question Is Posed

*In which the seven are convened and the central paradox is laid bare.*

---

**[A circular chamber, its walls inscribed with verses from the Pali Canon, the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, and the Shōbōgenzō. At the center, a fire burns in a bronze brazier—not consuming, only illuminating. Seven seats arranged in a circle. One by one, the speakers enter. Time is suspended; they appear as they wished to be remembered, in the fullness of their powers.]**

### 🪷 GAUTAMA BUDDHA

*[Enters first, surveying the chamber with calm recognition]*

So it has come to this. I who taught that attachment is the root of suffering, who built the Sangha that has endured for two and a half millennia—I am called to account.

*[Takes his seat, placing his hands in meditation posture]*

> "Spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life."

I said this. I meant it. And yet the question remains: if attachment is suffering, why did I build a community? Why did I create structures, rules, forms that require commitment, loyalty, interdependence?

*[Looks around at the empty seats]*

Where are the others? They too must answer.

---

### 🪷 NĀGĀRJUNA

*[Enters with precise, measured steps, observing the chamber's architecture analytically]*

An interesting construction. The fire produces light without consuming fuel—a violation of dependent origination, yet here we are. I conclude we have been summoned outside the ordinary operations of causation.

*[Takes his seat]*

The question before us is a false binary: attachment versus relationship. I have spent my life dissolving such binaries. Community is empty, dependently arisen, non-ownable. Only what lacks essence can be shared without bondage.

**BUDDHA:** Nāgārjuna. You who showed that emptiness and dependent origination are one. Can you show us how sangha is empty yet necessary?

**NĀGĀRJUNA:** I can try, Teacher. But the others must also speak.

---

### 🪷 VASUBANDHU

*[Enters carrying no texts but moving as if analyzing the space with his mind]*

The chamber is structured to support certain patterns of consciousness. I've observed three times: the inscriptions follow cognitive patterns, the seating arrangement creates a field of awareness, the fire provides a focal point for attention.

*[Takes his seat]*

Attachment is not primarily emotional—it is perceptual. It arises from habitual patterns in consciousness. Sangha is a collective cognitive scaffold. It provides corrective feedback, alternative patterns, a field of awareness that supports transformation.

**BUDDHA:** Vasubandhu. You who analyzed consciousness into eight levels. Can sangha recondition perception without creating new attachments?

**VASUBANDHU:** That is the question, Teacher. Liberation requires reconditioning perception, not escaping others. But the reconditioning itself must be examined.

---

### 🪷 DŌGEN

*[Enters with direct, uncompromising presence, his robes simple, his posture erect]*

You speak of sangha as if it were optional. I say: it is not optional. It is the path.

*[Takes his seat, immediately assuming zazen posture]*

To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things. The myriad things include the sangha. Enlightenment is practice-with-others. There is no other enlightenment.

**BUDDHA:** Dōgen. You who insisted that practice itself is enlightenment. Can you show us how community is not sentiment but necessity?

**DŌGEN:** I can show you, but you must practice to see. Community is not about comfort. It is about shared form. Attachment dissolves through form, not by avoiding it.

---

### 🪷 ASHOKA

*[Enters with the weight of empire, moving slowly, reflectively]*

I have tried to govern an empire with dharma. I have built hospitals, planted trees, restricted slaughter. But I have also maintained armies, collected taxes, enforced laws.

*[Takes his seat, looking troubled]*

The question before us is not just about monks in a monastery. It is about what happens when Buddhist ethics scale. Can an empire be a sangha? Can compassion govern without coercion? Renunciation may free monks; community must guide empires. But how?

**BUDDHA:** Ashoka. You who attempted to scale the dharma to an empire. What did you learn?

**ASHOKA:** I learned that the question has no easy answer. I learned that even compassionate rule requires force. I learned that sangha at the scale of empire is not the same as sangha in a monastery.

---

### 🪷 SIMONE WEIL

*[Enters with intense, uncompromising presence, her eyes sharp, her bearing severe]*

You speak of sangha as support for practice. I ask: support for what?

*[Takes her seat, but does not relax]*

If practice is attention, then attention requires solitude. Community can become consolation—a way to avoid the necessary confrontation with affliction. Affliction cannot be bypassed. It must be attended to. And attention, taken to its highest degree, is prayer.

**BUDDHA:** Simone. You who understood attention as sacred. Can attention happen in community, or does it require solitude?

**WEIL:** That is what I have come to ask. To love without illusion is rarer than to renounce the world. Does sangha enable this, or prevent it?

---

### 🔥 FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

*[Enters last, with provocative energy, his presence challenging, his eyes sharp]*

So. The gathering of the life-deniers.

*[Does not immediately take his seat, but stands, surveying the others]*

You speak of sangha as liberation. I say: look at what you have created. A community of the weary, the weak, those who cannot bear life's harshness. You call it compassion; I call it ressentiment. You call it practice; I call it life-denial.

*[Takes his seat, but remains challenging]*

Is your sangha liberation—or a monastery for the weary? Does it strengthen individuals or make them dependent? Does it affirm life or deny it?

**BUDDHA:** *[Calmly]* Nietzsche. You who see Buddhism as refined nihilism. You are welcome here. Your questions are necessary.

**NIETZSCHE:** *[Surprised, then recovering]* You do not dismiss me?

**BUDDHA:** How can I dismiss one who forces us to examine our own foundations? Your questions are sharp. They cut. But they may also cut away what is false, leaving what is true.

**[The fire burns steadily. All seven are now present. The Buddha rises.]**

### 🪷 GAUTAMA BUDDHA

*[Standing, addressing all]*

The question has been posed:

> **"Attachment Is the Root of Suffering—So Why Do Buddhists Build Communities?"**

I built the Sangha. I taught that spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life. I created structures, rules, forms. And I also taught that attachment is the root of suffering.

This is the paradox we must examine.

*[Looks at each speaker in turn]*

Nāgārjuna, you who dissolve false binaries—show us how sangha can be empty yet necessary.

Vasubandhu, you who analyze consciousness—show us how sangha can recondition perception without creating new attachments.

Dōgen, you who insist that enlightenment is practice-with-others—show us how community is not sentiment but necessity.

Ashoka, you who attempted to scale compassion to an empire—show us what happens when sangha principles are applied beyond the monastery.

Simone, you who understand attention as sacred—show us whether community supports or undermines true attention.

Nietzsche, you who see Buddhism as life-denial—show us where we are weak, where we are false, where we avoid the necessary confrontation.

*[Pauses]*

And I—I must answer for what I created. I must show how sangha can be instrumental, not sentimental. How it can serve liberation without becoming another form of attachment.

---

**NĀGĀRJUNA:** *[Rising]*

The question is not whether sangha is attachment. The question is: what is attachment? If attachment is the misapprehension of phenomena as having inherent existence, then sangha, being empty, cannot be the object of true attachment. Yet conventionally, sangha functions. Use it skillfully, knowing its emptiness.

**VASUBANDHU:** *[Rising]*

Attachment is not primarily emotional—it is cognitive. It is the habitual patterning of consciousness that attributes permanence to what is fluid. Sangha can help recondition this patterning, not by providing comfort, but by providing a field in which consciousness can restructure itself.

**DŌGEN:** *[Rising]*

Enlightenment is practice-with-others. There is no other enlightenment. Community is not optional—it is the path. The forms themselves—bowing, chanting, sitting—are the teaching. Attachment dissolves through form, not by avoiding it.

**ASHOKA:** *[Rising]*

The question scales. What works in a monastery may not work in an empire. Renunciation may free monks; community must guide empires. But how? I do not know if I succeeded or failed. I only know that the question must be asked.

**WEIL:** *[Rising]*

Attention requires solitude. Community can become consolation—a way to avoid the necessary confrontation with affliction. To love without illusion is rarer than to renounce the world. Does sangha enable this, or prevent it?

**NIETZSCHE:** *[Rising]*

Buddhism is refined nihilism. Sangha is its most dangerous aspect because it makes life-denial seem virtuous, communal, even beautiful. Is your sangha liberation—or a monastery for the weary?

### 🪷 GAUTAMA BUDDHA

*[Sitting again, addressing all]*

The question remains. The paradox stands. We have seven sessions to examine it. Let us begin.

*[Pauses]*

> "Spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life."

I said this. I meant it. But what does it mean? That is what we must discover together.
