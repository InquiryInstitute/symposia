## Overview

In a timeless space where the constraints of history are suspended, seven towering figures—six Buddhist masters and one existential prosecutor—gather to confront the most fundamental paradox of Buddhist practice: if attachment is the root of suffering, why do Buddhists build communities?

**The Question Before Them:**
> Attachment Is the Root of Suffering—So Why Do Buddhists Build Communities?

This symposium explores the tension between renunciation and relationship, between individual liberation and collective life, between the path of the lone ascetic and the necessity of spiritual friendship.

## The Panelists

### 🪷 The Six

#### 1. Gautama Buddha — Founder of the Sangha
**Role:** Original paradox-holder

The Buddha personally oscillated between:
- Radical renunciation
- Deeply structured communal life

He can defend sangha as instrumental, not sentimental.

*"Spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life."* (Upends the lone-ascetic myth.)

---

#### 2. Nāgārjuna — Philosopher of Emptiness
**Role:** Conceptual dissolver

Nāgārjuna annihilates the false binary:
- Attachment vs. relationship
- Individual liberation vs. collective life

Community, for him, is empty, dependent, non-ownable.

*"Only what lacks essence can be shared without bondage."*

---

#### 3. Vasubandhu — Psychologist of Mind
**Role:** Cognitive analyst

Vasubandhu reframes attachment as:
- Habitual patterning of consciousness
- Misattribution of permanence

Sangha becomes a collective cognitive scaffold, not an emotional refuge.

*"Liberation requires reconditioning perception, not escaping others."*

---

#### 4. Dōgen — Practice Radical
**Role:** Anti-romantic disciplinarian

Dōgen insists:
- Enlightenment is practice-with-others
- Community is not optional—it is the path
- Attachment dissolves through shared form

*"To study the self is to forget the self—together."*

---

#### 5. Ashoka — Political Realist
**Role:** Civilization-scale experimenter

Ashoka brings the uncomfortable question:
- What happens when Buddhist ethics scale?
- Can compassion govern without coercion?

He forces the sangha question into law, welfare, punishment, and power.

*"Renunciation may free monks; community must guide empires."*

---

#### 6. Simone Weil — Severe Mystic
**Role:** Ethical absolutist

Not Buddhist, but devastatingly aligned:
- Attention as sacred act
- Affliction (malheur) cannot be bypassed
- Community risks becoming consolation

She presses Buddhism where it hurts most.

*"To love without illusion is rarer than to renounce the world."*

---

### 🔥 The +1 Heretic

#### 7. Friedrich Nietzsche — The Prosecutor
**Role:** Existential antagonist

Nietzsche attacks on three fronts:
- Compassion as life-denial
- Community as softening force
- Buddhism as refined nihilism

He refuses reconciliation.

*"Is your sangha liberation—or a monastery for the weary?"*

---

## Themes

The symposium will explore:

1. **The Paradox of Spiritual Friendship** — How can community serve liberation without becoming another form of attachment?

2. **Emptiness and Relationship** — If all phenomena are empty, what is the nature of sangha? Can emptiness be shared?

3. **Cognitive Scaffolding** — Is sangha a tool for reconditioning perception, or an escape from the work of individual practice?

4. **Practice as Collective** — Can enlightenment be achieved alone, or is it inherently relational?

5. **Scaling Compassion** — What happens when Buddhist ethics move from monastery to empire? Can sangha principles govern?

6. **The Risk of Consolation** — Does community soften the necessary confrontation with suffering, or deepen it?

7. **The Nihilism Charge** — Is Buddhism's renunciation a form of life-denial? Does sangha make it better or worse?
