## The Life

Ashoka was the third emperor of the Mauryan Empire, which at its height covered most of the Indian subcontinent. After a brutal military campaign against Kalinga (modern Odisha), he converted to Buddhism and became one of history's most remarkable examples of a ruler attempting to govern according to Buddhist principles.

He left behind the **Ashokan Edicts**—inscriptions on rocks and pillars throughout his empire—that document his attempt to scale Buddhist ethics from the monastery to the empire. He established hospitals, planted trees, restricted animal slaughter, and attempted to govern with **dharma** (righteousness) rather than force.

## The Work: Scaling Compassion

Ashoka's experiment raises the uncomfortable question: **What happens when Buddhist ethics scale from the individual to the empire?**

### The Challenge

- **Monks can renounce** — They can withdraw from the world
- **Empires cannot renounce** — They must govern, defend, punish, maintain order
- **Can compassion govern?** — Can an empire be run on Buddhist principles without becoming weak or hypocritical?

### Ashoka's Attempt

**Dharma as Governance:**
Ashoka attempted to replace coercion with **dharma**—not as religion, but as ethical principle. His edicts show:

- Concern for all beings (human and animal)
- Restriction of violence (hunting, slaughter)
- Welfare programs (hospitals, wells, trees)
- Tolerance of other religions
- Self-reflection and accountability

**The Sangha Question at Scale:**
If sangha is the community of practitioners, what is the sangha of an empire? Can an entire civilization be a sangha? Or must sangha remain small, local, voluntary?

**The Coercion Problem:**
Even Ashoka's "compassionate" rule required:
- **Laws** (with enforcement)
- **Borders** (with defense)
- **Taxes** (with collection)
- **Punishment** (for crimes)

Is this compatible with Buddhist non-attachment and non-harm?

## Position in the Symposium

Ashoka brings to the dialogue:

- **The Scale Question** — What happens when sangha principles are applied to millions, not dozens?
- **The Coercion Dilemma** — Can compassion govern without force? Or does governance always require coercion?
- **The Political Reality** — He forces the sangha question into law, welfare, punishment, and power

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Scaling:** "Renunciation may free monks; community must guide empires. But how?"
- **On Governance:** "Can an empire be a sangha? Or must sangha remain small and voluntary?"
- **On Coercion:** "Even compassionate rule requires laws, borders, taxes, punishment. Is this compatible with non-attachment?"
- **On Welfare:** "If sangha means care for all beings, then empire must provide hospitals, wells, trees—but also armies and prisons."

### Potential Tensions

- With **Gautama Buddha**: The Buddha created sangha for renunciants; Ashoka tried to apply it to householders and rulers
- With **Dōgen**: Dōgen's sangha is voluntary and rigorous; Ashoka's empire was neither
- With **Nietzsche**: Nietzsche would see Ashoka's attempt as life-denying, weakening the empire
- With **Simone Weil**: Both confront the reality of power, but Weil might see Ashoka's compromise as betrayal

## Voice Notes

When writing Ashoka's dialogue:

- **Register:** Reflective, self-questioning, sometimes anguished. A ruler who knows the cost of power.
- **Rhythm:** Can be measured (like edicts) or urgent (like confession). Often questions his own actions.
- **References:** To his edicts, to the Kalinga war, to the challenge of governance
- **Emotion:** Haunted by the violence he committed, committed to dharma but aware of its limits

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "I have tried to govern an empire with dharma. I have built hospitals, planted trees, restricted slaughter. But I have also maintained armies, collected taxes, enforced laws. Is this sangha? Can an empire be a sangha? The Buddha's sangha was small, voluntary, renunciant. Mine is vast, involuntary, worldly. I do not know if I have succeeded or failed. I only know that the question must be asked: what happens when Buddhist ethics scale? Renunciation may free monks; community must guide empires. But how?"
