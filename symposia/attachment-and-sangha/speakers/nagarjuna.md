## The Life

Nāgārjuna is considered the founder of the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school of Mahayana Buddhism. Little is known of his life with certainty, but tradition holds that he was a Brahmin who converted to Buddhism and became one of its most profound philosophers.

He is credited with systematizing the doctrine of **śūnyatā** (emptiness), showing that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence. His *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way) remains one of the most important texts in Buddhist philosophy.

## The Work: Emptiness and Dependent Origination

Nāgārjuna's central insight is that **emptiness (śūnyatā)** and **dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda)** are not two different things—they are the same. All phenomena exist only in relation to other phenomena; nothing has independent, inherent existence.

This dissolves the false binary between:
- **Attachment vs. relationship** — If all is empty, what is there to attach to?
- **Individual liberation vs. collective life** — If the self is empty, what is the individual?

### Key Philosophical Moves

**The Two Truths:**
1. **Conventional truth (saṃvṛti-satya)** — The world as it appears, including relationships, communities, sangha
2. **Ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya)** — The emptiness of all phenomena, including sangha

Both are true, but at different levels. Sangha exists conventionally; ultimately, it is empty.

**Dependent Origination:**
> "Whatever is dependently arisen, that is explained to be emptiness."

Sangha is dependently arisen—it exists only because of causes and conditions. This means it is empty, but also that it can be skillfully used.

**The Middle Way:**
Nāgārjuna avoids two extremes:
- **Eternalism** — The view that things (including sangha) have permanent essence
- **Nihilism** — The view that because things are empty, they don't exist at all

Sangha is neither permanent nor non-existent. It is dependently arisen, empty, and useful.

## Position in the Symposium

Nāgārjuna brings to the dialogue:

- **Conceptual Precision** — He can dissolve false binaries that trap other speakers
- **The Emptiness of Community** — Sangha, like all phenomena, is empty—but this doesn't negate its usefulness
- **Non-Ownership** — If sangha is empty, one cannot truly "own" it or be "attached" to it in the way that causes suffering

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Attachment:** "Only what lacks essence can be shared without bondage." True sharing requires emptiness.
- **On Relationship:** Relationship is not the problem; the misapprehension of relationship as having inherent existence is the problem.
- **On Community:** Sangha is a conventional truth—real in its way, empty in another. Both perspectives are necessary.
- **On Liberation:** Individual liberation is a misnomer—there is no individual to liberate, only patterns of dependent origination to transform.

### Potential Tensions

- With **Vasubandhu**: Both analyze mind, but Nāgārjuna's emptiness is more radical than Vasubandhu's cognitive analysis
- With **Dōgen**: Both value practice, but Nāgārjuna's emptiness might seem to undermine Dōgen's insistence on form
- With **Nietzsche**: Nāgārjuna's emptiness might be accused of nihilism, but he would reject this—emptiness is not nothingness

## Voice Notes

When writing Nāgārjuna's dialogue:

- **Register:** Precise, logical, dialectical. Uses paradox and negation.
- **Rhythm:** Methodical. Builds arguments step by step, then dissolves them.
- **References:** To his own verses, to the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, to logical analysis
- **Emotion:** Calm, analytical. Can be sharp in logical refutation, but not personal.

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "You ask: is sangha attachment? I answer: what is sangha? It is dependently arisen—monks, nuns, teachings, practices, all arising together. It has no inherent existence. Can one be attached to what has no essence? The attachment itself is empty. The sangha is empty. The one who might be attached is empty. Yet conventionally, sangha functions. Use it skillfully, knowing its emptiness."
