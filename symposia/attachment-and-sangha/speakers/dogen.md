## The Life

Dōgen was a Japanese Zen master who founded the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism. He traveled to China at age 23 to study Chan Buddhism, achieved enlightenment under Rujing, and returned to Japan to establish Eihei-ji, one of the two head temples of Sōtō Zen.

He is known for his radical insistence that **practice itself is enlightenment**—not a means to an end, but the end itself. His major work, the *Shōbōgenzō* (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye), contains 95 fascicles of profound philosophical and practical teachings.

## The Work: Practice-Enlightenment

Dōgen's most radical teaching is that **practice and enlightenment are not separate**:

> "To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things."

This actualization happens **together**—not in isolation. For Dōgen, community is not optional; it is the path itself.

### Key Teachings

**Practice-Enlightenment (shushō-ittō):**
Enlightenment is not a future goal achieved through practice. Enlightenment **is** practice. And practice happens in community.

**Body-Mind Dropped Away (shinjin-datsuraku):**
In deep practice, the distinction between self and other, body and mind, drops away. This happens most reliably in the context of sangha.

**Continuous Practice (gyōji):**
Enlightenment is not a one-time event but continuous practice. This continuity is maintained through the sangha's shared forms and rhythms.

**The Zendo as Sacred Space:**
The meditation hall (zendo) is not just a building—it is the actualization of Buddha-nature. Sitting together in the zendo is itself enlightenment.

### Anti-Romantic Disciplinarian

Dōgen is **not** romantic about community. He is strict, demanding, and uncompromising:

- Community is not about comfort or belonging
- It is about **shared form** that dissolves attachment
- The forms themselves (bowing, chanting, sitting) are the teaching
- Attachment dissolves **through** form, not by avoiding it

## Position in the Symposium

Dōgen brings to the dialogue:

- **Practice as Collective** — Enlightenment is practice-with-others, not individual achievement
- **Form as Liberation** — The structures of sangha (not their absence) dissolve attachment
- **Anti-Romanticism** — Community is not sentimental; it is rigorous, demanding, transformative

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Enlightenment:** "Enlightenment is practice-with-others. To study the self is to forget the self—together."
- **On Community:** "Community is not optional—it is the path. The zendo is not a building; it is Buddha-nature actualized."
- **On Attachment:** "Attachment dissolves through shared form. The forms themselves—bowing, chanting, sitting—are the teaching."
- **On Practice:** "Continuous practice is maintained through sangha. Individual practice without sangha is incomplete."

### Potential Tensions

- With **Gautama Buddha**: Both value sangha, but Dōgen takes it further—enlightenment IS practice-with-others, not just supported by it
- With **Nāgārjuna**: Dōgen's emphasis on form might seem to contradict Nāgārjuna's emptiness, but Dōgen would say form IS emptiness
- With **Nietzsche**: Nietzsche might see Dōgen's forms as life-denying, but Dōgen would insist they are life-affirming

## Voice Notes

When writing Dōgen's dialogue:

- **Register:** Direct, uncompromising, sometimes paradoxical. Uses concrete images.
- **Rhythm:** Can be abrupt, cutting. Also capable of long, flowing passages on practice.
- **References:** To zazen (sitting meditation), to the zendo, to his own writings, to the forms of practice
- **Emotion:** Intense but not sentimental. Demanding but not harsh. Deeply committed.

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "You ask: can one practice alone? I answer: what is practice? Practice is zazen. Zazen is sitting. But sitting where? In the zendo, with others. The zendo is not a building—it is Buddha-nature. When you sit in the zendo, you sit with all beings. This is not metaphor. This is actual. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be actualized by myriad things. The myriad things include the sangha. Enlightenment is practice-with-others. There is no other enlightenment."
