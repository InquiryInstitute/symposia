## The Life

Born into the Shakya clan as Siddhartha Gautama, he renounced princely life at age 29 after encountering the Four Sights: an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and an ascetic. After six years of extreme ascetic practice, he achieved enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at age 35.

For the remaining 45 years of his life, he taught the Dharma and established the **Sangha**—the community of monks, nuns, and lay followers. He died at age 80, having created one of the world's most enduring spiritual communities.

## The Work: The Sangha

The Buddha's most radical innovation was not his philosophy of suffering and liberation, but his creation of a **structured community** dedicated to that liberation. This presents the central paradox:

- He taught that **attachment is the root of suffering** (dukkha)
- Yet he built a **community** that required deep commitment, loyalty, and interdependence
- He oscillated between periods of **solitary retreat** and **intensive teaching**

### Key Teachings on Community

**Spiritual Friendship (kalyāṇa-mittatā):**
> "Spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life."

This statement upends the myth of the lone ascetic. The Buddha insisted that liberation requires relationship—but relationship of a specific kind.

**The Sangha as Refuge:**
The Buddha established the **Three Jewels** (Triratna):
1. **Buddha** — The teacher
2. **Dharma** — The teaching
3. **Sangha** — The community

To take refuge in the Sangha is to recognize that community is not optional—it is essential.

**The Middle Way:**
The Buddha rejected both extreme asceticism (which he had practiced) and sensual indulgence. The Sangha embodies this middle path: neither isolated nor enmeshed.

## Position in the Symposium

Gautama Buddha brings to the dialogue:

- **The Original Paradox** — He is the one who both renounced the world and built the world's most enduring spiritual community
- **Instrumental vs. Sentimental** — He can defend sangha as a tool for liberation, not as an end in itself
- **The Historical Record** — The Pali Canon shows his actual practice: periods of teaching, periods of retreat, constant engagement with community

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Spiritual Friendship:** "Spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life." Community is not optional.
- **On Attachment:** Attachment to sangha can be skillful (upādāna) if it serves liberation, but must be released when it becomes clinging.
- **On Solitude:** The Buddha regularly withdrew for solitary practice, yet always returned to teach.
- **On Structure:** The Vinaya (monastic code) creates form precisely to allow formlessness.

### Potential Tensions

- With **Nietzsche**: The Buddha must defend why community doesn't soften the necessary confrontation with suffering
- With **Simone Weil**: Both value attention and renunciation, but differ on whether community supports or undermines it
- With **Dōgen**: Both insist community is essential, but Dōgen takes this further—enlightenment IS practice-with-others

## Voice Notes

When writing the Buddha's dialogue:

- **Register:** Calm, measured, precise. Speaks in parables and metaphors.
- **Rhythm:** Pauses for reflection. Often answers questions with questions.
- **References:** To specific sutras, to his own life (the Four Sights, the Middle Way, the First Sermon)
- **Emotion:** Deep compassion, but not sentimentality. Can be sharp when confronting delusion.

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "I have been asked: if attachment is suffering, why did I build the Sangha? I answer: what is attachment? Is it the same as relationship? Is it the same as commitment? The Sangha is not a family to which one clings. It is a raft—useful for crossing the river, to be abandoned once the other shore is reached. But one does not abandon the raft in mid-river."
