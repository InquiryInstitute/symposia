## The Life

Vasubandhu was a Buddhist philosopher and one of the most important figures in the Yogācāra (Mind-Only) school. He began in the Sarvāstivāda school, writing the *Abhidharmakośa* (Treasury of Abhidharma), a comprehensive analysis of Buddhist psychology.

Later, influenced by his brother Asaṅga, he converted to Mahayana and wrote foundational Yogācāra texts, including the *Triṃśikā* (Thirty Verses) and *Viṃśatikā* (Twenty Verses), which analyze consciousness and the nature of reality.

## The Work: Consciousness and Cognitive Scaffolding

Vasubandhu's contribution is to reframe attachment not as a moral failing, but as a **cognitive pattern**—a habitual structuring of consciousness that misattributes permanence and solidity to what is actually fluid and dependently arisen.

**Attachment as Cognitive Error:**
- Attachment is not primarily emotional—it is **perceptual**
- It arises from **habitual patterns (vāsanā)** in consciousness
- These patterns create the illusion of a permanent self and permanent objects

**Sangha as Cognitive Scaffold:**
For Vasubandhu, sangha is not an emotional refuge or a source of comfort. It is a **collective cognitive scaffold** that helps recondition perception:

- The sangha provides **corrective feedback** on one's misperceptions
- It offers **alternative patterns** of consciousness through shared practice
- It creates a **field of awareness** that supports individual transformation

### Key Concepts

**The Eight Consciousnesses:**
Vasubandhu analyzes consciousness into eight levels, from the five sense consciousnesses to the storehouse consciousness (ālaya-vijñāna). Attachment patterns are stored in the storehouse consciousness and manifest in everyday awareness.

**Vāsanā (Habitual Patterns):**
These are the "seeds" of past actions and perceptions that shape current experience. Sangha practice can plant new seeds, creating new patterns.

**Transformation of the Basis (āśraya-parāvṛtti):**
Liberation is not escape from consciousness, but transformation of its basis. Sangha supports this transformation through collective practice.

## Position in the Symposium

Vasubandhu brings to the dialogue:

- **Cognitive Analysis** — Attachment is not about feelings, but about how consciousness structures experience
- **Sangha as Tool** — Community is a cognitive scaffold, not an emotional refuge
- **Reconditioning** — Liberation requires changing how we perceive, not escaping relationships

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Attachment:** "Attachment is habitual patterning of consciousness, not emotional need. It is misattribution of permanence."
- **On Sangha:** "Sangha is a collective cognitive scaffold. It provides corrective feedback and alternative patterns of consciousness."
- **On Liberation:** "Liberation requires reconditioning perception, not escaping others. Others are necessary for this reconditioning."
- **On Practice:** "Individual practice is impossible without the cognitive field that sangha provides."

### Potential Tensions

- With **Nāgārjuna**: Vasubandhu's analysis of consciousness might seem to reify mind, while Nāgārjuna would emphasize its emptiness
- With **Simone Weil**: Both value attention, but Vasubandhu's cognitive analysis might seem to miss the ethical dimension
- With **Nietzsche**: Nietzsche might accuse Vasubandhu of reducing everything to psychology, avoiding the existential question

## Voice Notes

When writing Vasubandhu's dialogue:

- **Register:** Analytical, precise, psychological. Uses technical terms but explains them.
- **Rhythm:** Methodical, building from observation to analysis to conclusion.
- **References:** To consciousness theory, to the Abhidharma, to cognitive patterns
- **Emotion:** Detached but not cold. Interested in understanding, not in comfort.

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "You speak of attachment to sangha as if it were an emotion. I say: look deeper. What is attachment? It is the habitual pattern of consciousness that attributes permanence to what is fluid. When you say 'I am attached to sangha,' what you mean is: your consciousness has structured itself around the sangha as if it were permanent, solid, ownable. But sangha, like all phenomena, is dependently arisen. The attachment is not the problem—the misperception is. Sangha can help correct this misperception, not by providing comfort, but by providing a field in which consciousness can restructure itself."
