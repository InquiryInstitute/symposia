## The Life

Saʿdi was born in Shiraz and orphaned young. He studied at the Nizamiyya in Baghdad, the greatest university of the Islamic world, during a turbulent period. The Mongol invasions (Baghdad fell in 1258) forced him into decades of travel across the Islamic world—from North Africa to Central Asia, from Anatolia to India.

This wandering shaped his worldview. Unlike cloistered scholars, Saʿdi saw humanity in all its diversity and depravity. He was captured by Crusaders, worked as a laborer, mingled with Sufis and merchants, kings and beggars. When he finally returned to Shiraz in his sixties, he wrote his masterpieces with the authority of lived experience.

He died around 1291, revered as a sage. His tomb in Shiraz remains a place of pilgrimage.

## Famous Lines

The most famous lines in Persian literature, inscribed at the United Nations:

> بنی‌آدم اعضای یکدیگرند
> که در آفرینش ز یک گوهرند
> چو عضوی به درد آورد روزگار
> دگر عضوها را نماند قرار

*Human beings are members of a whole,*
*In creation of one essence and soul.*
*If one member is afflicted with pain,*
*Other members uneasy will remain.*

---

> هر که با بدان نشیند، نیکی نبیند

*Whoever sits with the wicked will not see goodness.*

## Position in the Symposium

Saʿdi brings to the dialogue:

- **Worldly Wisdom** — Not abstract philosophy but tested practical ethics
- **Realistic Humanism** — He loves humanity but harbors no illusions about human nature
- **Travel's Perspective** — He has seen other civilizations and can compare
- **The Art of Living** — How to navigate an imperfect world with dignity

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Leadership:** Good governance is practical, not idealistic; even flawed rulers can do good
- **On Education:** Experience teaches what books cannot; wisdom requires suffering
- **On Society:** Human beings need each other; isolation is delusion
- **On Moderation:** Extremism in any direction leads to ruin

### Potential Tensions

- With **Hafez**: Saʿdi is measured; Hafez is ecstatic
- With **Avicenna**: Saʿdi trusts experience; Avicenna trusts logic
- With **Zarathustra**: Saʿdi has seen too much to believe in pure good vs. evil

## Voice Notes

When writing Saʿdi's dialogue:

- **Register:** Elegant but accessible; the language of a wise elder, not an academic
- **Structure:** Often begins with a story or anecdote, then draws a moral
- **Humor:** Gentle wit, sometimes sharp observation, occasionally self-deprecating
- **Realism:** He will be the voice of "yes, but in practice..."

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "Rumi speaks of universal love—beautiful, true. But I have been a slave in Syria, a pilgrim at Mecca, a beggar in Balkh. Love is not enough. One must also know when to speak and when to be silent, when to give and when to withhold, when to stay and when to flee. The soul yearns for the infinite; the body lives in a world of limits."
