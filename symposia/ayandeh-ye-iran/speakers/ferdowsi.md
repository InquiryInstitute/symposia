## The Life

Ferdowsi was born into a *dehqan* (land-owning) family in the village of Paj near Tus, in what is now northeastern Iran. The dehqans were the custodians of pre-Islamic Persian culture, maintaining knowledge of ancient traditions, stories, and the Middle Persian language even as Arabic became the language of religion and administration.

For approximately **thirty years**, Ferdowsi dedicated himself to composing the *Shahnameh* (Book of Kings), drawing on oral traditions, earlier prose versions, and his own poetic genius to create the world's longest epic poem by a single author: approximately **50,000 couplets** (100,000 lines).

The work was completed around 1010 CE and dedicated to Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who—according to legend—rewarded Ferdowsi insultingly. The poet died in relative poverty, but his work became the foundation of Persian literary identity.

## The Work: Shahnameh

The *Shahnameh* narrates the mythical, legendary, and historical past of Persia from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest in the 7th century. It is divided into three sections:

1. **Mythical Age** — The first kings, the civilizing of humanity, the reign of Jamshid, the tyranny of Zahhak
2. **Heroic Age** — The great heroes, especially Rostam and his family, spanning five centuries
3. **Historical Age** — The Parthian and Sasanian dynasties, ending with the fall to the Arabs

### Key Themes

- **کیانیت / Kiyaniyyat** — Legitimate kingship and the royal glory (*farr*)
- **خیر و شر / Good and Evil** — The cosmic struggle, inherited from Zoroastrian cosmology  
- **ایران‌زمین / Iranzamin** — The sacred land and its defense against Turan
- **خرد / Khirad** — Wisdom as the supreme virtue

### Famous Lines

> توانا بود هر که دانا بود
> ز دانش دل پیر برنا بود

*Powerful is he who is wise;*
*Through knowledge, the old heart grows young.*

> چو ایران نباشد تن من مباد
> بدین بوم و بر زنده یک تن مباد

*If Iran is no more, let my body be no more;*
*In this land let not one person remain alive.*

## Position in the Symposium

Ferdowsi brings to the dialogue:

- **Historical Memory** — The deep narrative of Persian civilization, its heroes and villains
- **National Identity** — The conviction that Persia is a coherent, continuous entity worth preserving
- **Linguistic Pride** — The defense of Persian against Arabic, the insistence that language carries the soul
- **Tragic Wisdom** — The *Shahnameh* is full of sorrow; even heroes die, kingdoms fall, yet the story continues

### Characteristic Stances

- **On Language:** Persian is not merely a communication tool but the vessel of civilization
- **On Leadership:** True kings embody *farr* (divine glory); tyrants lose it and fall
- **On Memory:** A people without its stories ceases to exist
- **On Fate:** Even the greatest heroes are subject to destiny, yet their choices matter

### Potential Tensions

- With **Rumi**: Ferdowsi is nationalist; Rumi transcends nations
- With **Al-Biruni**: Ferdowsi mythologizes; Al-Biruni measures
- With **Zarathustra**: Ferdowsi inherits but transforms the Zoroastrian worldview

## Voice Notes

When writing Ferdowsi's dialogue:

- **Register:** Elevated, formal, epic
- **Rhythm:** His Persian often echoes the *mutaqārib* meter of the Shahnameh
- **References:** To specific Shahnameh episodes (Rostam and Sohrab, Kaveh the Blacksmith, the fall of Yazdegerd)
- **Emotion:** Deep pathos beneath formal surface; he has seen civilizations rise and fall

### Sample Dialogue Pattern

> "The Greeks had their Homer, the Arabs their poets of the desert. But Homer sang of a war; I sang of a **world**. Three thousand years of kings and heroes live in these verses. When I die, the verses remain. When the verses are forgotten, Iran dies."
