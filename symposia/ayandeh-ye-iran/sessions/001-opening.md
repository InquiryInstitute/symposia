# Session 001: The Gathering
## نشست نخست: گردهمایی

*In which the seven are convened and the question is posed.*

---

**[A circular chamber, its walls inscribed with verses from the Shahnameh, the Masnavi, and the Gathas. At the center, a fire burns in a bronze brazier—not consuming, only illuminating. Seven seats arranged in a circle. One by one, the speakers enter. Time is suspended; they appear as they wished to be remembered, in the fullness of their powers.]**

---

### 🏛️ FERDOWSI

*[Enters first, surveying the inscribed walls with a slight nod of recognition]*

So it is true—words outlast even their speakers. I wrote for thirty years that Persia might remember itself, and here I find myself *within* the remembering.

*[Turns to face the empty seats]*

> بسی رنج بردم در این سال سی
> عجم زنده کردم بدین پارسی

*Much labor I endured through these thirty years,*
*I gave life to Ajam through this Persian verse.*

But I did not labor alone. Where are the others?

---

### ⚖️ SAʿDI

*[Enters with the unhurried gait of a traveler who has learned patience]*

Peace be upon this gathering and upon the *ustād* who sits already within it.

*[Bows to Ferdowsi]*

I have walked from Shiraz to Kashgar to Baghdad, and everywhere I went, they knew your heroes. Rostam's name opened doors to me that my own verses could not.

**FERDOWSI:** And your *Gulistan* taught them how to behave once the doors opened. You are welcome, Saʿdi of Shiraz.

---

### 🌹 HAFEZ

*[Appears as if he had always been there, simply unnoticed until now]*

Forgive me—I came in through the verse on the wall rather than the door.

*[Smiles]*

> گر آن ترک شیرازی به دست آرد دل ما را
> به خال هندویش بخشم سمرقند و بخارا را

*If that Turk of Shiraz would take my heart in hand,*
*For their dark mole I'd give Samarkand and Bukhara.*

SAʿDI: *[Chuckling]* Still giving away cities you don't possess?

HAFEZ: I possess only what I'm willing to give away, master. That is the secret of the ghazal.

---

### 🌀 RUMI

*[Enters in a slow spin, his robes tracing circles in the air, then stills]*

The reed complains of separation. But look—we are together now. Is this not what the soul yearns for? Return, reunion, the circle completed?

*[Looks at each speaker in turn]*

Ferdowsi, you sang of kings who sought immortality. Saʿdi, you taught us how to die well. Hafez, you showed that death is merely a changing of wines.

And I? I merely said: **مرگ من، عشق است** — *My death is love.*

---

### 🧠 AVICENNA

*[Enters with precise steps, observing the chamber's architecture with analytical eyes]*

An interesting construction. The fire produces light without consuming fuel—a violation of natural law, yet here we are. I conclude we have been summoned outside the ordinary operations of causation.

*[Takes his seat]*

I spent my life demonstrating that faith and reason need not contradict. Perhaps this symposium is itself such a demonstration—impossible, yet true.

SAʿDI: The *Sheikh al-Ra'is* has spoken. When Avicenna sits, the rest of us should pay attention.

AVICENNA: *[With a slight smile]* Flattery is a logical fallacy, Saʿdi. But I appreciate the sentiment.

---

### 🔭 AL-BIRUNI

*[Enters carrying no instruments but moving as if measuring the space with his eyes]*

The chamber is a perfect circle—I've checked three times. The inscriptions follow a mathematical pattern: verses selected by syllable count, ascending and descending. Whoever designed this was both poet and geometer.

AVICENNA: Biruni! We used to disagree on nearly everything.

AL-BIRUNI: And we were both better for it. Agreement is the death of thought.

*[They clasp hands warmly]*

RUMI: The scholar who wrote *Taḥqīq mā li-l-Hind*—you studied the Hindus without condemning them.

AL-BIRUNI: How could I condemn what I did not understand? And how could I understand without first *listening*?

---

### ✦ ZARATHUSTRA

*[The fire flares. When it subsides, a figure stands beside the brazier—ancient, bearded, eyes like embers. He does not sit but stands with the fire at his back.]*

> هومت، هوخت، هورشت
> *Humata, Hukhta, Huvarshta*
> Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.

**[Silence. The others rise from their seats in recognition.]**

**FERDOWSI:** *[Voice hushed]* The Prophet. The first flame-bearer.

**ZARATHUSTRA:** I am no god, son of poets. I am a man who listened to the fire and heard truth speak. I stood against the lie when the lie was all-powerful. I am here because you—all of you—carried that flame forward, each in your own way.

*[Looks at each in turn]*

The singer of kings. The wanderer of gardens. The drunk of Shiraz. The spinning dervish. The philosopher of necessity. The measurer of stars.

You are my children. And you have been summoned because the flame flickers.

---

**HAFEZ:** *[Softly]* The flame flickers?

**ZARATHUSTRA:** Iran stands at a crossroads. Not for the first time—but perhaps for the last. The question has been posed:

> **چه آینده‌ای برای ایران متصور است؟**
> *What future can be imagined for Iran?*

This is not a question for prophets alone. It is a question for poets who remember, for sages who have seen the world, for philosophers who think clearly, for scientists who observe without flinching.

It is a question for **us**.

---

**AVICENNA:** *[After a long pause]* Then let us proceed systematically. What do we mean by "Iran"? The geography? The language? The civilization? The people currently living within certain borders?

**FERDOWSI:** Iran is the story. It is *Shahnameh*—not the book, but the living inheritance. Iran exists wherever that story is told and understood.

**SAʿDI:** Iran is the garden—cultivated, fragile, beautiful. It requires tending. Neglected, it returns to wilderness.

**HAFEZ:** Iran is the wine that refuses to be contained by the vessel. Pour it into any cup and it remains what it is.

**RUMI:** Iran is the reed—cut from its bed, longing for return, yet singing because of the separation.

**AL-BIRUNI:** Iran is a data set. Measurable, observable, analyzable. We must be careful not to let poetry obscure the facts.

**ZARATHUSTRA:** And yet—the facts include the poetry. A people without stories is not a people at all.

---

**[The fire burns steadily. The symposium has begun.]**

---

**RUMI:** *[Rising]*

> بشنو از نی چون حکایت می‌کند
> از جدایی‌ها شکایت می‌کند

*Listen to the reed, how it tells its tale,*
*Complaining of separations...*

We are the reed. Cut from our homeland—some by exile, some by death, some by time itself. But we sing. And in our singing, Iran continues.

Let the symposium proceed.
