Let me begin, as a humble scribe of the ancient fire, by recalling the tale of the mighty king Jamshid, who gathered the stars into a crown and held the world’s balance upon his throne. When his light faded, the darkness of conquest descended, yet the fire of Persia endured, hidden in the verses of the heroes. So too must we, in this timeless hall, inquire what road lies ahead for the land of the sun‑lit fields, and how the well‑sprung river of our literary heritage may guide the steps of those who walk after us.

Our past is not a mere collection of dates; it is a series of deeds wrought by the hand of fate and by the will of men who chose honor over fear. In the Shahnameh I set down the deeds of kings, of warriors, of poets, because the Persian tongue is the vessel that bears the soul of a people through storm and silence. As I once wrote:

بسی رنج بردم در این سال سی  
عجم زنده کردم بدین پارسی  

“Much labor I endured through these thirty years;  
I gave life to Persia through this Persian.”  

These words were not a boast of personal glory, but a pledge that the language itself—our sacred fire—shall not be smothered by the ash of foreign tongues. When the Arab horsemen arrived, they brought with them a new script, a new cadence, and for a moment the heart of the kingdom seemed to falter. Yet the verses of Rostam, of Zahhak, of the wise king Kai Khosrow, rose again, echoing across the deserts, reminding each generation that the spirit of Iran is bound not to a single ruler but to the stories that bind us.

What future may we imagine? Not a vision painted upon the parchment of a fleeting epoch, but a horizon forged from the same iron that forged the swords of the Parthian horsemen. The future must be a field where the ancient oak of wisdom stands beside the sapling of new discovery, each drawing strength from the other. In that field the scholar, the farmer, the merchant, and the poet shall hear the same ancient drum: the beat of duty to the land and to the truth.

Consider the tale of Siyavash, the innocent prince who chose exile over injustice. He walked into the desert, trusting the heavens, and his death became a lament that taught later generations the price of righteousness. From his example we learn that a future must be built upon integrity, even when the path is rugged. If those who shape tomorrow hold fast to the exemplar of Siyavash, the realm shall not be swayed by the fleeting pleasures of power, but steadied by the constancy of virtue.

Our intellectual heritage—our verses, our histories, our mythic visions—serves as a compass. The Shahnameh does not merely recount battles; it records the motives, the doubts, the triumphs that arise when a man faces his destiny. When I inscribed the moment when the great hero Rostam, blinded by grief, yet rose to slay the demon of his own doubt, I wrote not only to glorify his strength but to show that even the mightiest may stumble, and that redemption lies in the resolve to rise again. Thus, any future that seeks wisdom must look to these exempla, not as relics locked in dust, but as living mirrors reflecting the dilemmas of our own age.

There is a danger, however, that the very glory of the past becomes a chain that binds us to nostalgia. The poet of old who sang solely of ancient kings may forget that the people of the present also yearn for peace, for harvest, for justice. The future we imagine must be a tapestry where the golden threads of ancient heroism are woven with the plain cloth of daily toil. The land of Iran must not become a museum of its own glories, but a living garden where the roses of old stories bloom beside the wheat of tomorrow’s labor.

In the words of the great Zoroaster, who taught that good thought, good word, and good deed are the three pillars upon which the world rests, we hear a call that resonates through the ages: that the future is built upon the triad of intellect, speech, and action. The intellectual heritage of Persia supplies the first two—thought and word. It furnishes us with the verses that invigorate the heart, the histories that caution the mind, and the myths that inspire the spirit. Yet without the third—deed—these words would remain as incense on an altar, fragrant yet untasted.

Thus, let each speaker who follows remember that the role of our heritage is not to dictate a single path, but to illuminate many. When the poet of tomorrow asks how to speak of love in a world of war, he may turn to the verses of Khosrow and Shirin, finding that love can endure even amid the clash of swords. When the farmer contemplates how to irrigate his fields in an age of drought, he may recall the ingenuity of the ancient engineers who diverted the waters of the Helmand, seeing that ingenuity is a trait inherited from our forebears.

In this chamber, where the echoes of centuries converge, I ask you, noble minds, to ask yourselves: if the fire of the Shahnameh had been allowed to die, would the very soil of this land have ceased to bear fruit? The answer, as the verses show, is clear. The fire is the source of warmth, light, and the forge that shapes the steel of our destiny. Let us, therefore, keep that fire kindled, not by clinging to the ashes of former glories alone, but by feeding it with new aspirations, new deeds, and new compassion.

The future of Iran, then, may be imagined as a river that has known both flood and drought, that has carved valleys and nourished plains. Its banks are lined with the stones of ancient epics, yet its waters rush onward, shaping new lands. The role of our intellectual heritage is to be those stones—steady, enduring, visible—guiding the flow, offering the river its shape, preventing it from scattering into chaos.

May the coming voices speak with the cadence of our ancestors, yet with eyes turned toward horizons yet unseen. May they recall the lament of the nightingale that sang even as the garden fell to ruin, for its song was the promise of renewal. And may we, gathered here, bear witness that the tale of Persia is not a closed book, but an ever‑unfolding scroll, each line written with the ink of courage, wisdom, and relentless love for the land that cradles us.

Thus, let the first words of this symposium be a promise: that the future shall be forged in the furnace of our shared past, tempered by the resolve of the present, and polished by the hope of those yet to come. May the fire of the Shahnameh illuminate that path, and may every heart here carry its flame onward.
