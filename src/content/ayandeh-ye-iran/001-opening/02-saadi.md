The echo of Ferdowsi’s voice still lingers in this hall, a fire that has warmed many hearts with the tales of kings and heroes. He has reminded us that the Shahnameh is the great vessel in which the spirit of Persia sails, that the language of our ancestors carries the marrow of our identity. I honor the blaze he has kindled, for without the heroic past we would wander blind. Yet, as a traveler who has walked the deserts of Morocco, the bustling bazaars of Delhi, and the shattered plains of Khwarezm after the Mongol horde swept across, I have learned that a fire, however bright, must be fed not only by the embers of legend but also by the oil of daily conduct.

Allow me, then, to tell a story that may temper the heroic flame with the humble light of practical wisdom. Long ago, when the sky over Khwarezm was blackened by the dust of countless horsemen, I found myself among a group of merchants whose caravan had been halted by a band of marauders. The leader of the band, a man with a scar across his cheek, demanded tribute. The merchants, fearing loss of their wares, offered what they could. Yet one of them, a modest weaver named Razi, stepped forward and said, “If you take my cloth, you shall have a garment for the night, but you shall also take the reputation of a man who steals from a brother.” The scarred chief, amused, allowed the weaver to keep a small piece for himself. Later, when the marauders reached a village where the people welcomed them with food, the same chief found himself humbled by the generosity of strangers who, despite the danger, shared their bread. He returned to the caravan, not with the spoils of war, but with a lesson: that the hand that gives is lighter than the hand that takes, even when the world seems to demand the latter.

From that episode I distilled a proverb that has followed me across seas: *“The hand that gives is lighter than the hand that takes, and the heart that forgives is more steadfast than the heart that holds a grudge.”* In the Gulistān I wrote, “بنی‌آدم اعضای یکدیگرند که در آفرینش ز یک گوهرند؛ اگر یکی از آنها رنج برد، تمام بدن درد می‌کشد.” — *Human beings are members of one body; when one part aches, the whole body feels the pain.* This truth, observed in the shattered villages of Persia after the Mongol arrows fell, remains as vital today as when the dust first settled.

Ferdowsi’s call to let the fire of the Shahnameh illuminate the path forward is a noble one, yet the path is not a single road paved solely with heroic epics. It is a network of lanes where merchants, scholars, farmers, and children meet. The Shahnameh provides the compass—its north points toward courage, honor, and the love of country. Yet the traveler must also know how to tend the oxen, repair the cart, and share the water at the oasis. In my own journeys, I have seen that the most lasting kingdoms are those that understand the rhythm of daily life, that value the honesty of a market clerk as much as the bravery of a warrior.

Consider the ruined city of Baghdad after the Mongol siege. Its libraries, once brimming with the works of scholars, lay in ashes. Yet the city rose again, not because the memory of its past glories alone sustained it, but because its citizens remembered to teach their children to read, to mend roofs, to care for the sick. The lesson is that cultural heritage, however splendid, must be coupled with ethical practice. A ruler may commission a splendid palace, but if he neglects the grain store, famine will follow. A poet may compose verses of love, but if the common folk are denied justice, the verses will fall on deaf ears.

In the Bustan I wrote, “If you would be a true lover of your nation, you must first love the poor and the humble, for they are the roots that hold the tree of civilization.” The roots cannot be ignored, lest the tree topple in a storm. This is not a call for idle sentiment, but a pragmatic observation: a society that feeds its hungry, protects its travelers, and resolves disputes with fairness will endure longer than one that relies solely on the memory of heroic deeds. The Mongols taught me this starkly. Their swords could fell walls, but they could not sustain a realm where the fields were left untended and the people despised.

Thus, the future I imagine for Iran is a garden where the roses of heroic tradition blossom beside the wheat of honest labor. It is a garden tended by those who, like the gardener, prune the vines of arrogance, water the seedlings of compassion, and pull up the weeds of corruption. The language of our poets—be it the lofty meter of the Shahnameh or the simple couplet of the Gulistān—will be the irrigation that carries wisdom to every corner of the field. Yet the gardener must also know when to sow, when to harvest, and when to share the yield with neighbors.

A ruler who wishes to harness this garden must remember that power, like fire, is a necessary evil. It can warm the hearth and melt the iron for plowshares, but it can also scorch the fields if left unchecked. I have heard the lament of a king who, after a victorious campaign, ordered the execution of a learned judge because the judge dared to advise restraint. The king’s victory turned to bitterness, for without counsel the kingdom fell into discord. The lesson is that counsel, especially from those who have walked many roads, is a lantern in the dark corridors of authority. The wise ruler, therefore, should surround himself with men and women who have seen the world beyond his palace walls, for they will remind him that the weight of a crown is light only when balanced by humility.

In practical terms, this means encouraging education not merely in poetry but in the arithmetic of trade, in the art of medicine, in the craft of building. It means establishing markets where a farmer can sell his grain without fear of extortion, where a carpenter can practice his trade without the threat of unjust seizure. It means that the courts should hear the pleas of the poor as earnestly as those of the noble, for justice that favors only one class is a hollow echo of the ancient tales.

To the scholars and teachers gathered here, I say: let the verses of Hafez, Rumi, and the great Ferdowsi be your companions, but also be the ones who translate those verses into deeds. Teach the young that a generous heart is more valuable than a golden coin, that a truthful tongue builds bridges stronger than any wall. To the merchants, remember that a fair price today secures a loyal customer tomorrow; the road of honesty is long, yet it leads to a market that never dries. To the artisans, let your work be a prayer, for the beauty you create lifts the spirit of the city as surely as any battle hymn.

In closing, I recall the words I once wrote to a wandering dervish who asked whether the world could be changed: “There are seven answers to every question; the wise listen to all, then choose the one that brings the most benefit.” The future of Iran is not a single answer, but a chorus of many—heroic poetry, ethical commerce, compassionate governance, and the everyday acts of kindness that bind the body of humanity. Let us, therefore, tend both the fire of the Shahnameh and the hearth of the common house, so that the light that shines from Persia reaches not only the halls of kings but also the humble courtyards where families gather.

May the garden we cultivate together bear fruit for generations, and may the wisdom of our ancestors guide each step, not as a distant echo, but as a living current that waters the soil of our present.
