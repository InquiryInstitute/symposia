The tapestry of Iran is woven with the threads of sky and stone, of numbers and verses, of the measured turn of the heavens and the unmeasured pulse of the heart.  I have spent my life in the shade of the great observatory of Isfahan, counting the days, arranging them into a calendar that, when the western sun is set against the horizon, keeps its own counsel more faithfully than the Gregorian reckoning.  Yet I have also lingered in the garden of Shiraz, where the rose whispers to the night and the cup of wine—true or imagined—offers a fleeting respite from the endless march of ages.

Our forebears have spoken: Ferdowsi sang of heroes whose swords cleaved the darkness; Saʿdī taught the farmer the virtue of kindness; Rumi, the lover, lifted the veil of the soul; Avicenna bound reason to the divine.  Al‑Biruni, whom we have just heard, has shown us the rigor of observation, the exactitude of measurement, the humility that follows when the heavens reveal a law we did not foresee.  I raise my own cup to him, for in his tables of latitude and his surveys of the earth’s breadth there is a clarity that mirrors the precision I seek in numbers.

Yet, as the astronomer counts the planets, the poet asks: what does the count signify?  The calendar I crafted—twelve months, each a fine subdivision of the solar year, the intercalary days placed where the sun’s shadow falls just so—does not answer the question of why the world turns at all.  It tells us when the wheat will ripen, when the pilgrim may set out for Mecca, when the court will summon a new tax.  It is a weapon against chaos, a compass for traders and shepherds alike.  That precision, however, is a map; it does not tell us the story of the traveler who follows it.

Al‑Biruni measured the earth, the stars, the rivers, the heights of mountains.  He taught us that the world does not reveal itself at once, that each observation is a step on a ladder that never reaches the summit.  I salute that humility: to admit that the horizon recedes as we advance.  Yet I must add the voice that has ever lingered at the edge of his tables: the voice that asks whether the measurement itself is enough to fill the cup.  Numbers are certain as the stone of the citadel, but they are mute.  They do not laugh when the wine spills, nor do they weep at the passing of a beloved.  In the quiet after a calculation, I hear the echo of a question: *What profit is there in a perfect calendar if the heart beats in a rhythm it cannot read?*

The answer, perhaps, lies in the paradox that a mathematician can also be a poet.  When I reduced the cubic equation to a geometric construction, I felt the same pleasure as when the rose unfurled at dawn.  The equation  

\[
x^{3}+ax^{2}+bx+c=0
\]

is not merely a series of symbols; each term is a stone in a bridge leading from ignorance to insight.  The solution I offered—by intersecting a parabola with a circle—was a proof, a certainty that can be repeated and verified.  It is a lamp that burns with a steady flame, unlike the flickering fire of a tavern where a minstrel sings:

> **به هر گلِ سرخ که می‌روی، باده‌ست و گِل؛**  
> *“With every crimson rose you pass, there is wine and mud.”*  

And in the same breath, the quatrain that has travelled beyond our lands:

> **به یاد دارم چو باده بنوشم، دل می‌زند**  
> **از غم و شادی، به خویشتن نهان**  
> *“I remember, when I drink the wine, my heart beats—*  
> **from grief and joy, hidden within itself.*”*  

These lines, though humble in language, bear the same weight as any theorem: they capture a truth that cannot be measured, yet is felt as surely as the turning of the Earth beneath our feet.

When we speak of the future of Iran, we must ask what we wish the numbers to count.  Shall the calendar guide us to a renaissance of learning, where scholars in the madrasa of Ray may once again converse with the great minds of Alexandria, Babylon, and Samarkand?  Shall the precision of our astronomers and the boldness of our engineers give rise to canals that tame the rivers, to roads that bind the deserts, to bridges that join the peoples of the plateau?  I can see a future where the science we cherish does not stand apart from the art we cherish, where the mathematician and the poet share the same table.

But I also hear a quieter voice, the one that rises when the wine cup clinks against the stone.  It asks: *If all the calendars align, if every star is charted, will the soul still wander in the night?*  The answer, I think, is both yes and no.  The calendar will keep the seasons honest, and the algebra will keep the mind sharp; yet the heart will still seek the taste of the unknown, the shadow of a rose that never fully opens.  Our heritage, then, is not a set of doctrines to be imposed upon the future, but a collection of lenses through which we may gaze upon it.

Let us imagine Iran as a garden where the rows of wheat are measured with the same care as the rows of verse.  Let the scholars of mathematics plant their theorems as seeds, and let the poets water them with wine, laughter, and the occasional sigh.  In such a garden, the future is not a fixed pattern awaiting revelation, but a living tapestry woven each day by the hands of those who count and those who dream.

To Al‑Biruni I say: your tables are the scaffolding of our civilization; they hold the heavens aloft for us to contemplate.  To the mystics, I offer the certainty that the moon will rise again, even if its light does not illuminate the path we walk.  To the poets, I give the assurance that the equation has a solution, even when the variables seem impossible.  And to all who listen, I raise my cup—perhaps filled with wine, perhaps with water, perhaps with nothing at all—and invite you to taste the present, for it is the only moment we truly possess.

In the end, when the last page of the calendar is turned, when the final proof is written, when the final verses are sung, the world will still turn, indifferent to our triumphs and our doubts.  Yet within that indifferent turn, we may find a space to linger, to love, to question, and to drink.  Let us therefore seize the day, not because we are certain of tomorrow, but because the certainty of today—its numbers, its verses, its wine—offers us a brief, sweet refuge from the vast, unknowable night.

*May the light of the stars guide our measures, and may the scent of the roses guide our hearts.*
