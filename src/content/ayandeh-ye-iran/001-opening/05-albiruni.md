Our discourse today follows a line drawn by those who have spoken before us: Ferdowsī, who sang the deeds of heroes; Saʿdī, who urged us to act with virtue; Rūmī, who lifted our hearts toward the love that binds the soul to the Divine; and Ibn Sīnā, whose treatise on the concord of aql and īmān has shown the value of a reasoned order in medicine, philosophy, and the institutions that bind scholars. I wish to add a voice that leans toward the instrument of measurement, toward the careful eye that watches the heavens and the earth, and toward the humility that arises when the hand of observation meets the mind of speculation.

I recall the words of Ibn Sīnā, who has rightly praised the systematic arrangement of knowledge, comparing the scholar’s mind to a well‑ordered library in which each volume supports the next. He has reminded us that the intellect, when guided by revelation, can build edifices of understanding. Yet, as I have often argued in the letters we exchanged, a structure built upon conjecture alone may stand firm only until the wind of experience blows. The firmest foundations, in my experience, are those laid upon the scales of measurement (miyār) and the marks of repeated observation (murājaʿa).

In the deserts of Khwārazm, the sun’s path was a daily teacher. By observing the shadow of a gnomon at noon, and measuring the angle between the sun’s rays and the ground, I calculated the latitude of my own camp. Repeating this at the summer and winter solstices, I charted the variation of the sun’s declination. From these data I derived the length of a degree of the meridian arc, and, by comparing the distance between two locations whose latitudes differed by a known number of degrees, I obtained an estimate of the Earth’s circumference. The result, differing by less than one‑half of a percent from the value now accepted by the most exact astronomers, shows that when the hand of measurement is steady, the mind may trust its conclusions.

Such a result is not a triumph of abstract reasoning alone; it is the fruit of a chain of observations: the length of a shadow, the timing of the sun’s culmination, the distance traveled on foot or by caravan, the careful counting of steps, the use of the measuring rope (ḍabṭ). Each link in this chain is vulnerable, and each must be examined. When I found a discrepancy in the lengths of my steps recorded by different travelers, I corrected the values by a process of qiyās (comparison) and by using a standard rod of known length. In this way, the measurement becomes a dialogue between the observer and the instrument, a dialogue that refines itself.

Our heritage, inherited from the sages of Persia, has taught us the value of reason, yet it has also warned us against the pride of certainty without proof. The “Qadim” of the ancient scholars, those early astronomers who plotted the heavens with great care, left us tables of planetary motions that still guide our calculations. Yet they also left us the admonition that “the knowledge of the heavens is a servant to the knowledge of the earth,” meaning that celestial calculations must be grounded in terrestrial experience. This principle guides my own work, and it should guide the future of Iran.

When I journeyed to the lands of Hind, drawn by the invitation of the great emperor and the curiosity of the learned, I found a civilization whose scholars had recorded the motions of the planets with a precision that rivaled our own, and whose physicians had compiled materia medica from the forests of the subcontinent. I learned from the Sanskrit treatise on astronomy, the Siddhānta, that the length of the sidereal year was measured by counting the vernal equinoxes across generations. Their method of using water clocks (ghurab) and of marking the position of the sun against fixed stars provided a parallel to our own techniques, yet expressed in a different symbolic language.

In my “Kitāb al‑Hind,” I recorded not only the religious rites and philosophical doctrines of the Hindus, but also the methods by which they measured the height of a mountain by the length of its shadow at noon, and the way they estimated the distance to a distant city by the time taken for a messenger to travel. These observations taught me that the pursuit of knowledge is not confined to a single tongue or tradition; it is a universal endeavour that thrives on exchange. The Indian scholars, though often wrapped in the garb of their own cosmology, displayed a rigor of measurement that deserves respect. Their willingness to test the predictions of their calculations against the observed positions of the stars reminds us that curiosity, when coupled with verification, is a lamp that can illuminate any darkness.

Thus, when we ask what future may be imagined for Iran, we must first ask what tools we shall employ to shape that future. Will we rely solely upon the harmony of aql and īmān as a perfect internal balance, or shall we also let the external world speak to us through its measurable signs? The answer, I propose, lies in a synthesis that gives precedence to observation (muraqaba) while allowing reason to organise the data. The institutions that Ibn Sīnā envisions—houses of learning, hospitals, libraries—must be filled not only with treatises of pure philosophy, but also with tables of measured data, with instruments for timing, for weighing, for mapping. The scholars who will inherit these halls must be taught to sharpen their eyes as well as their minds.

Consider the rivers that nourish our valleys: the Zayanderūd, the Karun, the Helmand. Their courses shift over decades, their floods rise and fall. A future in which we can predict their behavior—by measuring the volume of water each season, by noting the rise of the banks, by recording the timing of rains in the mountains—will protect our fields and our people. Such knowledge is not abstract; it is applied, and it rests upon the same method that gave us the Earth’s circumference. If we extend this practice to the heavens, we may better understand the timing of eclipses, the paths of comets, and the calculation of the qibla for our mosques, thereby aligning our worship with the movements of the cosmos.

Moreover, the medical tradition that Ibn Sīnā so eloquently defended must be enriched by the observations of physicians from distant lands. The herbs of the Indian jungles, the surgical techniques of the Chinese, the anatomical dissections of the Greeks—all present data that, when measured and compared, can enhance our own pharmacopoeia. The greatest physicians are those who do not merely repeat the recipes of their masters, but who test each remedy, weigh each dosage, and note each outcome. In this spirit, the future of Iran’s health will be secured not by the authority of a single text, but by the accumulation of verified experience.

We must also be wary of the hubris that can arise from claimed mastery of all truths. In my own work, I have sometimes been led astray by the assumptions of local guides, whose estimates of distance were based on the speed of camels rather than on measured strides. When such errors were revealed by a careful recalibration of the measuring rope, I corrected the record, acknowledging my own fallibility. This humility, I contend, must be the hallmark of any future scholar. The pursuit of knowledge is an endless journey; each step forward must be taken with the awareness that the ground beneath may yet shift.

In closing, let us imagine an Iran that stands as a beacon of measurement and inquiry, where the towers of learning are equipped with astrolabes (al‑najm al‑miqyas) and quadrants, where scholars travel not only to the libraries of Baghdad or Cordoba, but also to the courts of Hind and the workshops of Greece, bringing back data that is recorded, compared, and refined. Let us cultivate a tradition where the harmony of reason and faith, praised by Ibn Sīnā, is enriched by the chorus of observation that sings from the fields, the rivers, the deserts, and the stars. By doing so, we honor the legacy of our ancestors, we fulfill the command of the Qurʾān to reflect upon the signs of Allah in the heavens and the earth, and we give to future generations a foundation upon which they may build new edifices of understanding.

May the light of measured knowledge guide us, and may our curiosity ever be tempered by the discipline of verification. This is the future I envision for Iran, a future rooted in the empirical while ever respectful of the spiritual, a future where the legacy of our intellectual heritage is not a static monument but a living laboratory. Let us, therefore, set our instruments, record our observations, and proceed together, step by measured step, toward that horizon.
