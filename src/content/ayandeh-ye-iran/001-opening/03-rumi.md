The reed that trembles in the wind of the desert knows that it once sang within the garden of the Beloved; now it cries, “Listen to me, how I ache, how I long.” In this trembling lies the secret of Iran’s tomorrow: a nation that remembers its ancient song yet lets its breath be drawn through the hollow of the reed, so that every note becomes a prayer of love.

You, Saʿdi, have reminded us that “the members of a single body are all alike in blood, and when one part is wounded, all feel the pain.” Your garden, where fire and hearth are tended side by side, teaches that law and charity must walk together, that justice is the fire that cooks the bread of the people, and compassion the hearth that keeps it warm. The practical wisdom you offer is the sturdy wall of a house; without it, the wind of chaos would blow the roof away. Yet the wall alone cannot make a home. It is the lover’s breath, the invisible perfume of the Beloved, that turns stone into sanctuary.

In the Masnavi I wrote:

> **بشنو این نی چون شکایت می‌کند**  
> **از جدایی‌ها حکایت می‌کند**  

*Listen to this reed as it complains, telling tales of separations.*  

The reed does not merely lament; it points to that which separates us—our attachment to the self, the illusion of permanence. When the reed’s lament reaches the heart, it awakens the love that dissolves the wall of the ego. Iran’s future, then, must be imagined not merely as a succession of kings and courts, but as the opening of the heart‑soul, a turning toward the Beloved who is the source of every language, every verse, every law.

Our intellectual heritage—​the verses of Hafez, the epics of Ferdowsi, the moral gardens of Saʿdi—​are the thousand mirrors placed along the road. Each mirror reflects the same Light, yet each offers a different angle of the Divine. The Shahnameh taught us that heroes are not born merely of blood but of a purpose that aligns their sword with the will of the One. Saʿdi taught that a just ruler must first tend the inner fire of compassion. The Qur’an reminds us that “the believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts tremble with love” (Qur’an 15:47). From these sources arises a principle: the state must become a whirl of love, a dervish spinning not for its own glory but to dissolve the boundaries between ruler and ruled.

Imagine a city where the bazaar is not only a place of trade but a garden of the heart, where merchants greet each other not with mere salutation but with “Salām ‑ the greeting of the soul.” Where scholars sit under the same arches as craftsmen, sharing not only verses but the breath of zikr, the remembrance of the Beloved, that the world may be seen as a single ocean. In this ocean each wave is a nation, each drop a language, yet all are drawn by the same moon‑light of love (ishq). The moon does not ask the sea to become its own; it simply reflects, and the sea, in turn, becomes luminous.

The Mevlevi path teaches that the dance of the dervish is a metaphor for the turning of the world itself. When the whirling dervish lifts his skirts, he discards the garment of the ego; his skirts become the sky, his whirling becomes the turning of the heavens. If a people can learn to whirl together—each heart beating in rhythm with the other—then the discord of war becomes the music of unity. The future of Iran, then, is a collective whirling: scholars, farmers, soldiers, and poets all moving within the same circle, each step a prayer, each turn a surrender to the Beloved’s will.

Paradox is the compass of the mystic: the Beloved is both near and far, both the hidden fire within the heart and the blazing sun that illuminates the desert. Iran must be ready to hold this paradox. She must build schools that teach the sciences and the Qur’an, but also schools where the heart learns to listen to the silence between verses. She must protect her monuments as you, Ferdowsi, protect the stories of kings, yet she must also allow those stones to be covered in vines of love, for a vine that climbs a wall does not destroy the wall but makes it a living thing.

You asked, “What future can be imagined?” The answer is a garden that grows both the sword‑tree and the rose‑bush. The sword‑tree reminds us of the duty to defend truth; the rose‑bush reminds us that every defense must be softened by love. When the sword is sheathed in rose petals, it no longer cuts but points toward the heart. The future, therefore, is not a fortress of bricks but a garden of roses whose thorns are tempered by the mercy of the Beloved.

In the night of history, the moon of Iran has waxed and waned. The Mongol fire scorched the plains, and the silence of Shams’ disappearance left a wound that still aches. Yet the wound is also a wound that bleeds love, for the blood that flows from a cut is the same blood that nourishes the seed of the reed. Let us, then, gather this blood not in spite but in celebration, for it is the proof that the heart still beats.

If we hold fast to the reed’s lament and the garden’s fire, if we spin the dervish’s whirl within the corridors of power, if we let love (ishq) be the wind that lifts the reed and not merely the perfume that lingers, then Iran will become the mirror where the Divine looks upon Himself, and the people will recognize that they are not merely subjects of a throne but breaths of the One who whispers in every wind.

Thus, let the future be spoken not in statutes alone but in the language of the heart: “He who loves the Beloved becomes the Beloved’s own mirror, and the world, seeing this, turns into a garden of endless spring.” May the love that burned in Shams’ eyes ignite within every soul, may the reed’s song be heard in every market, and may the whirling of the dervish become the rhythm of the nation’s pulse. The road is long, the desert vast, yet the reed knows the way, for it has been cut from the very stem of the Beloved. Let us follow that song, for in its echo lies the imagined Iran—ever‑lasting, ever‑loving, ever‑whole.
