Silence, for I was not summoned—yet the wine‑glass trembles, and I must tilt it toward you all.  

You have drawn the sword, the garden, the reed, the logic, the astrolabe, the quatrain of doubt; I come bearing the curl of the beloved’s hair and the scent of rose‑water that slips through the lattice of any grand design.  

Ferdowsi, you have bound the nation in heroic epics, as if the future were forged in the hammer of past battles. Saʿdi, you plant the seed of virtue in gardens, yet the garden is a fleeting breath of fragrance, not a map for tomorrow. Rumi, you dissolve the self into the Beloved, but the Beloved’s smile is a mirror that reflects not only eternity but the sparkle of the present cup. Avicenna, you weave reason and faith as if a thread can hold the whole tapestry, while the loom itself sways in the wind of a tavern song. Biruni, you measure the heavens with rulers, yet the heart cannot be calibrated. Khayyam, you write of wine and dice, but the dice are cast in the moment, not in some distant horizon.

Do any of these crowns of thought not miss the simple perfume of the rose that blooms now, the taste of the wine that brightens the tongue, the laughter that erupts when the cup runs dry? The future you seek to imagine is not a fortress built on stone verses; it is the fleeting tavern where the candle flickers, the wine flows, and the heart beats in rhythm with the drum of the present.

Allow me, then, to lay before you a couple of verses that the seekers of destiny have turned to for guidance, though they themselves were never meant to be read as manuals:

> **اگر آن ترک شیرازی بدست آید**  
> **به خال هندویش بخشم آرام جانم**  

*If that Shirazi Turk should fall into my hand,  
I would lay down the peace of my soul for his Indian mole.*

> **به بوی تو مستی دل نمانده است**  
> **ز شراب عشق می‌نوشم هر دم**  

*By your scent the heart’s intoxication lingers,  
I drink the wine of love at every breath.*

In these lines the world contracts to a single scent, a single swallow; the universe shrinks to the cup that is simultaneously full and empty.  

Thus I ask: what kingdom can be erected on the foundation of plans and doctrines when the very soil is soaked with the perfume of now? Does the great Shahnameh’s hero ever pause to sip, to feel the coolness of the cup against his lips? Does the sage who measures the stars ever notice that the night sky is also a canopy for lovers who whisper beneath its dome?

The heresy I offer is simple: let the grand systems be the scaffolding for a banquet, not the banquet itself. Let the beauty of a moment outweigh the weight of a manifesto. Let joy, however brief, become the compass by which we steer the ship of Iran’s tomorrow.

So raise your glasses, even if they are empty, for in their emptiness lies the promise of fullness. Drink, and let the future be a poem sung today, not a treaty written for tomorrow.  

May the cup forever be half‑full, and may the curl of the beloved’s hair guide us through the corridors of time.
