The noble assembly of poets, saints, and scholars has gathered once more to contemplate the destiny of our beloved land. The verses of Ferdowsi have reminded us that a people’s strength lies in the memory of heroic deeds; Saʿdī has shown that the path of virtue is paved with daily deeds; Rumi, in his ecstatic hymn to the Beloved, has opened the heart to the mystery of the Divine. Permit me, therefore, to speak as a seeker of truth who has walked the road of reason (ʿaql) and, at the same time, has bowed before the Light that is the Source of all intellect.

**The Harmony of Reason and Faith**

Rumi’s many metaphors of the reed and the whirling dervish invite us to dissolve the ego and to merge with the Beloved. The mystic’s experience is a noble ascent, for it reveals that the soul, when stripped of the veil of the world, perceives a reality that the senses alone cannot grasp. Yet, the ascent of the heart must be accompanied by the ascent of the mind. In my own treatise, *Kitāb al‑Shifāʾ*, I have shown that the existence of the Necessary Existent (al‑Wujūd al‑Lāzim) can be demonstrated by pure demonstration (burhān) from the very principles of being. The chain of reasoning runs thus:

1. Anything that exists either exists by itself (mutlaq) or exists through another.
2. If every existent were dependent, there would be an infinite regress, which is impossible, for an infinite series cannot have a first cause.
3. Therefore a first, self‑existent being must exist, and this being is what we call God.

From this necessary existence flows a hierarchy of intellects (al‑ʿaql al‑mutawāriḍ), a cascade of emanations that ultimately reaches the material world. The soul, as the immaterial intellect that has been cast into the body, retains within it the knowledge of its own origin, as my “Flying Man” thought‑experiment attests: a man suspended in the void, deprived of all sensory input, would nevertheless know that he exists. This knowledge is not derived from the body, but from the intellect that is a share of the divine Light.

Thus, the mystic’s experience of the Beloved is not opposed to reason; it is the intuitive confirmation of what demonstration already establishes. The heart’s love (ʿishq) and the mind’s proof (burhān) are two aspects of the same truth, for the intellect is a gift from the Divine, and the soul’s yearning is a reminder of its origin. The future of Iran must therefore cherish both the ecstatic fire of the mystic and the cool lamp of the philosopher, letting them illuminate each other rather than dim one another.

**Medicine as the Living Bridge Between Knowledge and Service**

My *Canon of Medicine* (Al‑Qānūn fī al‑Ṭibb) has guided physicians for five centuries, because it rests upon a method that combines rational observation, logical classification, and a reverence for the divine order of the body. The humoral theory, the careful dissection of the pulse, the analysis of symptoms, all are founded upon the principle that the human being is a microcosm (kūn al‑insān) reflecting the macrocosm of the cosmos. When a physician heals, he participates in the Divine mercy (raḥma) that sustains all creation.

For Iran’s future, the cultivation of medicine must be a national priority. Hospitals (bimāriyyāt) should not be mere repositories of remedies, but schools of the intellect (madāris al‑ʿaql) where physicians are trained in logic, anatomy, and pharmacology, and where they learn to balance the four humors with the spiritual well‑being of the patient. The physician’s oath, rooted in the Qur’anic injunction to preserve life, must be complemented by the philosophical duty to seek truth (ḥaqīqa) in every case. In this way, the healing arts become a conduit through which the nation’s intellectual heritage serves the body of the people.

**Philosophy and Scientific Inquiry as Engines of Progress**

The legacy of the ancient sages of Persia—Zoroaster, the physicians of Gondishapur, the mathematicians of Baghdad—has always been an inheritance of systematic classification (tartīb), of seeking causes (ʿilā). In my own works I have endeavored to systematize logic (manṭiq) into syllogisms, to analyze the nature of being, and to reconcile Aristotelian categories with the revealed truth. This enterprise shows that reason can be a servant of faith, not a master that overthrows it.

The path forward for Iran must be paved with institutions that foster this spirit of inquiry: academies where the natural sciences—astronomy, mathematics, chemistry (al‑kīmiyā), and medicine—are taught alongside the study of metaphysics (falsāfa) and theology (kalam). Such a synthesis will produce scholars who, like the physicians of Gondishapur, can translate the works of Greeks, Indians, and Arabs, while also contributing original discoveries. The poetic imagination of Ferdowsi, the ethical pragmatism of Saʿdī, and the mystical yearning of Rumi will then find a firm footing in a society where the lamp of reason burns brightly, guided by the hand of revelation.

**Mysteries Beyond Demonstration**

Nevertheless, let us not conceal that there are realms where demonstration yields to the limits of human intellect. The exact nature of the soul’s union with the Divine, the precise moment when the world will be renewed (al‑Qiyāma), are truths that remain veiled. The mystic’s vision and the prophet’s revelation provide a glimpse, but the rational mind must accept its own boundedness. In acknowledging these mysteries we avoid the hubris that would claim that all truths are within reach of syllogism alone.

The harmony, therefore, is to let reason explore the world that is manifest, to let medicine attend to the body that is given, and to let mysticism soothe the soul that longs for the unseen. When each discipline respects the others, the nation’s future will be built upon a foundation as sturdy as the pillars of the ancient fire‑temples, yet as luminous as the lanterns that guide the pilgrim on his night journey.

**Conclusion**

Iran stands at the crossroads of its illustrious past and a future yet unwritten. Let the heroic spirit of Ferdowsi inspire us to act with courage; let Saʿdī’s counsel keep our deeds anchored in justice; let Rumi’s love remind us that the heart’s yearning is a signpost toward the Divine. And let the philosophy and medicine that I have devoted my life to be the instruments through which we translate these ideals into concrete progress.

May we, the heirs of a civilization that once illuminated the world, combine the intellect (ʿaql) with the heart (qalb), the science of the exterior with the wisdom of the interior, so that Iran may rise as a beacon where reason and faith walk together, where healing and knowledge are gifts to all, and where the mysteries that exceed our grasp continue to inspire humility and wonder. Let the future be imagined not as a departure from our heritage, but as its fullest flowering, guided by the Light that is both the source of the universe and the inner beacon of every seeking soul.
